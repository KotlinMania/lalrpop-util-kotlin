/**
 * A single LALRPOP production, expressed as data the runtime can interpret.

 * The data-driven generated parser declares one [Production] per grammar
 * rule, holding:
 *
 * - `nonterminalId` — index used by the GOTO table to find the next state
 *   after the production reduces.
 * - `rhsLength` — how many stack entries the production pops before invoking
 *   [action].
 * - `action` — typed lambda that consumes the popped span [start..end] and
 *   the popped stack entries, and returns the symbol to push for the
 *   produced nonterminal.
 *
 * The action lambda receives the [ParseStack] and is expected to call
 * [ParseStack.pop] the appropriate number of times in the order the rule's
 * RHS lists. Returning a typed `S` (the per-grammar `Symbol` sealed class)
 * means there is no `Any` payload — the compiler enforces that the produced
 * symbol is one of the declared variants.

 *
 * Returns `Result<S>` because a production can fail (the user's grammar
 * action runs arbitrary Kotlin code that may throw). The driver inspects the
 * result, pushes on success, and propagates the throwable as a parse failure
 * on `Result.failure`. Strict typing constraint holds: the success payload
