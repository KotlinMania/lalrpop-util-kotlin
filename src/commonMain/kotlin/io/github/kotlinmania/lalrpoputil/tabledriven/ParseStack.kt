/**
 * Typed parse stack used by data-driven generated parsers.
 *
 * Each generated parser declares its own `Symbol` sealed class, with one
 * variant per distinct stack-element type. `ParseStack<S, L>` stores those
 * variants and lets reduction lambdas pop typed payloads back out.
 *
 * The stack stores [Located] triples (start location, symbol, end location)
 * to match the existing `ParserDefinition.reduce` contract — every push
 * carries the source span the symbol came from, and reductions can compute
 * the span of the produced symbol from the spans of its constituents.
 *
 * Pops are checked against the variant type at runtime via a sealed-class
 * cast. If the generated tables disagree with the lambdas (a codegen bug),
 * the cast fails fast with a typed exception rather than corrupting the
 * parse silently.
